# High Level System Design (HLD) Notes

This repository contains structured and interview-focused notes on **High Level System Design**, aimed at **software engineering interviews (SDE-1 / SDE-2 / Senior roles)** and real-world backend system understanding.

The content is organized to follow the **exact flow expected in system design interviews** — starting from requirement clarification and gradually moving towards architecture, scalability, and deep technical trade-offs.

## What this repository covers

- Functional Requirements (FR) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
- Identifying core entities and data modeling
- API design and service interfaces
- High-level architecture diagrams and component interactions
- Caching, databases, queues, and messaging systems
- Scalability, availability, latency, and consistency trade-offs
- Common system design patterns and real-world use cases
- Deep dives into bottlenecks, failure handling, and optimizations
- Interview-ready design flow and decision-making framework

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build **strong system design fundamentals**
- Develop **clear architectural thinking**
- Prepare for **system design rounds in product-based companies**
- Bridge the gap between **theoretical concepts and real-world systems**

These notes prioritize **clarity, simplicity, and practical reasoning** over over-engineering, making them suitable for both **interview preparation and long-term reference**.
